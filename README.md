## Bocconi 30509

The repository contains some key notes for the Bocconi computer programming course. \
All code is my product and inspired from the lectures given by prof. Luca Saglietti.

The repository is organized in folders:

0. Theory
1. Markov chain
2. Dynamic programming
3. Optimization
4. Past exams

---

### 0. Theory

There is no additional material to the slides, that are entirely provided and explained during the course.

---

### 1. Markov chain

In this section we explored memoryless processes in some possible applications. \
Topics covered include:

- Greedy optimization algorithm
- Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
- Montecarlo simulations
- Random walks
- Simulated annealing algorithm

---

### 2. Dynamic programming

In this section we explored the schema of dynamic programming in some possible applications. \
Topics covered include:

- Bottom up approach
- Forward and backward pass
- Shortest path

---

### 3. Optimization

In this section we explored the basics of multidimensional optimization in some possible applications. \
Topics covered include:

- Function minimization
- Gradient descent
- Least square optimization

---

### 4. Past exams

The exams are gathered from previous years' courses and are not sorted per difficulty. \
The solutions are hidden but I'd be happy to help to anyone interested :-)

N.B. The repository is not complete but offeres some key insights of the work done during the course.
